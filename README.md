About Institute Management System Django Project
In particular, this Institute management system project in Python Django focuses mainly on dealing with student-staff information. Also, the system displays selective overall data using graphical representations. In addition, the system allows managing students’ attendance. Evidently, this project is divided into three categories: Student, Staff, and Admin Panel. In an overview of this web application, a student can simply view and update his/her profile. Initially, an admin is responsible for students’ registration. In fact, he/she has to provide personal and login details. However, a student can view their attendance record under each enrolled subject. Also, the students can apply for leave days and view all their leave histories. Besides, students can view notifications from the Institute administration as well as provide feedback to the administrator.
Staff’s Panel, Attendance Management
Moving towards the staff/teacher’s panel allows users to access various features. But before, an admin is also responsible for staff registration. A staff member can manage results for each student. However, each result is only notable by the staff members. Meanwhile, the user can take and view the attendance of students. In fact, the teacher can only take attendance of the students enrolled in his/her concerned subjects. For this, the user has to select subjects and sessions. With it, the system displays the names of students with attendance dates. Additionally, the staff members can apply for leave days by providing details such as leave dates and messages. All the leave applications will be sent for approval by the admin. Besides, the user can view notifications from the administrator and send feedback.
Admin Panel
An administrator has full control over the system. He/she can manage courses, subjects, sessions, staff, students, and more. Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name and other important details. The very first step of the management of this system is to set up courses, subjects and sessions. There are minor fields for each such as name, description, and dates. This whole section plays an important role in the management of the staff, students, and attendance records. As each of these records falls under different sections. In Addition, the system allows managing staff records. The staff member refers to teachers in the context. For this, the user has to provide various details such as name, email address, gender, password, image, and course.
Student Management, Notifications, and Attendance
On one hand, the admin can insert students’ records by providing various details. Such as name, email, gender, password, image, course, and session. In addition to it, the user can send notifications to each student and staff member. This notification message can be used for anything. And it’s very simple, the admin has to select any of the available member records, type a message and send it. This helps to notify student and staff members about their concerned subject matters. Also, an administrator can view the attendance records of each student just by selecting the session and subject. As a result, the system provides names of available students with their status on each date. In fact, the system distinguishes absent students by using red and presents with green colors.
Leave Management and Feedback
On the other hand, all the leave applications sent by the staff members and students can be seen by the admin. Here, the admin has to take action against each application simply by approving or declining it. The admin can list out each application’s date, message, and name of the sender along with the enrolled course. After each action, the end-users can view it from their respective panels under the leave history section. Similarly, the same goes for the feedback section. An admin has to look up to each feedback and take action by replying. The replies would also be visible for each user from their respective panels under the feedback section. Besides, the system uses graphs and pie charts to display an overview of students’ attendance per subject and other important headings.
